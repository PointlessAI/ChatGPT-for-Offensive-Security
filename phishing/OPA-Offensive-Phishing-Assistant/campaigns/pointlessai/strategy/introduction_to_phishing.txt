### Introduction to Phishing

Welcome to our phishing training guide! Phishing is a widespread and growing threat that can compromise personal and organizational security. Understanding phishing's mechanics and its impact on individuals and businesses is essential to protect ourselves and maintain a secure working environment. This guide will introduce you to phishing, its methods, current trends, the differences between phishing and social engineering, and how phishing affects you.

### Methods of Phishing

Phishing typically involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details. Here are some common methods:

1. **Email Phishing:**
   Fraudulent emails mimic legitimate entities, urging recipients to click on malicious links or providing attachments that can steal credentials.

2. **Spear Phishing:**
   A more targeted form of phishing where attackers focus on specific individuals or organizations, tailoring their messages to appear more convincing.

3. **Whaling:**
   Aimed at high-profile targets such as executives, whaling attacks often masquerade as important business messages to trick recipients into disclosing sensitive information.

4. **Smishing:**
   Phishing attempts via SMS or text messages, often containing links to malware or fake websites.

5. **Vishing:**
   Phishing conducted through voice calls, convincing targets to reveal personal information over the phone.

### Current Trends in Phishing

Phishing tactics are constantly evolving. Some of the latest trends include:

- **Deepfake Phishing:**
  Utilizing AI-generated video or audio to impersonate business leaders or trusted individuals.

- **Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS):**
  Toolkits available on the dark web make it easier for less skilled hackers to launch phishing campaigns.

- **HTTPS Phishing:**
  Using seemingly secure websites (with HTTPS encryption) to create a false sense of security and trick recipients.

### Phishing vs. Social Engineering

While phishing is a form of social engineering, they are not the same. Social engineering is broader and involves manipulating people into divulging confidential information through various psychological techniques. Phishing specifically utilizes deceptive emails, texts, or calls for the same purpose.

| **Common Tactics**      | Fake links/sites, malicious attachments          | Pretexting, impersonation, tailgating          |
