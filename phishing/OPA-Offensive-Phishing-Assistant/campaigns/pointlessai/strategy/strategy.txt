Certainly! Here is a step-by-step strategy for a simulated phishing campaign, designed to educate and train users on how to recognize and avoid phishing attacks:

### Step 1: Define Objectives
1. **Awareness**: Educate employees on recognizing phishing attempts.
2. **Assessment**: Measure the current level of employee susceptibility to phishing attacks.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure training meets industry or regulatory requirements.
4. **Metrics & Reporting**: Track progress and identify areas for improvement.

### Step 2: Identify Target Audience
1. **List Creation**: Obtain a list of employees, departments, or user groups to include in the simulation.
2. **Segmenting**: Prioritize high-risk groups (e.g., HR, finance, IT) while ensuring a diverse cross-section of the organization.

### Step 3: Plan the Campaign
1. **Phish Concept**: Develop various scenarios that mimic real-world phishing attempts—examples include:
   - Spoofed emails from authority figures (e.g., CEO, HR)
   - Fake notifications from widely-used services (e.g., email, payment platforms)
   - Tempting offers (e.g., gift cards, vacations)
2. **Email Templates**: Create realistic email templates with convincing content but harmless payloads (e.g., dummy login pages).

### Step 4: Develop Tracking Mechanisms
1. **Redirection**: Redirect users who click phishing links to training content instead of real malicious sites.
2. **Monitoring**: Set up tracking to log actions such as email opens, link clicks, and form submissions.
3. **Reporting**: Implement tools capable of generating reports on user interactions with the simulated phishing emails.

### Step 5: Pre-launch Communication
1. **Announcement**: Inform users of forthcoming simulations as part of a broader phishing awareness initiative (without exact dates/times).
2. **Baseline Training**: Provide initial training material on recognizing phishing attempts and reporting suspicious emails.

### Step 6: Launch the Campaign
1. **Email Distribution**: Deploy phishing emails using a controlled release to selected user groups.
2. **Timing**: Vary the timing of emails to simulate real-world, unpredictable phishing attacks.
3. **Response Handling**: Set up incident handling and support for users who recognize and report the phishing email.

### Step 7: Post-Phishing Event Handling
1. **Immediate Redirect**: Direct users who fall for the phish attempts to a landing page that explains the simulation and provides educational material.
2. **Elicit Feedback**: Allow users to provide anonymous feedback on their experience with the simulation.

### Step 8: Review & Report
1. **Gather Data**: Collect and analyze engagement data—percentage of emails opened, click rates, form submission rates, and user-reported incidents.
2. **Generate Reports**: Create summary reports by department, role, or risk level to highlight areas needing improvement.

### Step 9: Follow-Up Training
1. **Close Gaps**: Provide additional, targeted training to groups with high susceptibility rates.
2. **Reinforcement**: Distribute reminders on phishing recognition and reporting periodically to keep awareness levels high.

### Step 10: Continuous Improvement
1. **Re-evaluation**: Regularly update phishing scenarios to reflect emerging threats.
2. **Repeat Campaigns**: Schedule follow-up phishing campaigns to measure improvement and adapt as necessary.
3. **Security Culture**: Promote a culture of security awareness and vigilance through ongoing education and incentives for proactive behavior.

By following these steps, you can run an effective and educational simulated phishing campaign that will help reduce organizational risk and improve overall security awareness.

Advanced methods based on modern trends
Building on the established strategy, let's integrate advanced elements based on modern phishing trends:

### Step 3: Plan the Campaign (Advanced Strategies)

1. **Advanced Phish Concepts**:
   - **Mobile Phishing Scenarios**: Design phishing emails that simulate mobile-optimized interfaces, understanding that a growing number of users access their emails on mobile devices. Include mobile-specific tactics such as SMS phishing (smishing) and mobile app notifications.
   - **Keyword Alert Emails**: Utilize popular business and team collaboration tools within emails (e.g., Slack alerts, Microsoft Teams messages) that users commonly interact with.
   - **AI-Powered Spoofs**: Create emails and landing pages using generative AI to craft highly personalized content that mimics interactions within the company, such as fake meeting requests or HR communications.
   - **Hybrid Phishing Scenarios**: Combine traditional phishing emails with vishing (voice or phone phishing), where an email request might be followed up with a phone call urging immediate action.
   - **QR Code Phishing**: Distribute fake company announcements or promotions containing QR codes that lead to phishing websites.

### Step 4: Develop Tracking Mechanisms (Advanced)

1. **AI Detection and Follow-up**:
   - **AI-enabled Email Analysis**: Implement AI-based monitoring that can detect suspicious email patterns and variations in user behavior when interacting with emails.
   - **Behavioral Dumps**: Use AI models that profile normal user behavior and flag anomalies that suggest successful phishing attempts.
   
2. **Advanced Metadata Collection**:
   - Collect detailed metadata not only on clicks and submissions but also timestamps related to reaction times and user login attempts across platforms after engaging with phishing content.
   
3. **Enhanced Report Analytics**:
   - Deploy machine learning tools that supersede basic click rates, templating threat patterns, integrating data across email, and user report trends.

### Step 6: Launch the Campaign (Advanced)

1. **Staggered Distribution**: Phishing attacks are diverse in real-world incidents; deploy emails via intelligently random schedules, maintaining realistic intervals, and time-of-day variance.
   
2. **Dynamic and Realistic Simulation**:
   - Offer constantly evolving tools/content theft alerts aligned to hot topics trending in your organization or industry, such as a sudden need to update "Worker Security Accounts" or "Cloud Access Pass".

### Step 7: Post-Phishing Event Handling (Advanced)

1. **Real-time Feedback and Interactive Education**:
   - Use immediate, interactive training pages following a failed phishing simulation that simulate further realistic engagement. Measure understanding with interactive quizzing assisted AI suggestions.
   
2. **Analog and Hybrid Feedback Methods**:
   - Incorporate vishing feedback loops, such as an educational response prompted by phone calls/texts if answers indicate complete engagement with a supervised crafted phishing attack, dynamically redirect to voice-to-text phishing boards.

### Step 8: Review & Report (Advanced)

1. **Predictive Analytics Reporting**:
   - Use collected telemetry from campaigns within your ML/AI integrations to predict future weaknesses organization-wide. Identifies areas needing mission-critical iterative reinforcements. Automated deciding scorecard creations emphasizing streamline gaps.

2. **Comprehensive User Audits**:
   - Detailed metrics for all participants: device types used, response time analysis, attack journaling, even time-zone based effectiveness.

### Step 9: Follow-Up Training (Advanced)

1. **Phasic Phishing Paths Recursive Education**:
   - Set up recursive trained paths structuring starting learning stages followed progressively simulated threat level increase aligning cement consistent adapted learned repeat interactions mastering eventual independence.

2. **Sentiment Analysis-Informed Educations**:
