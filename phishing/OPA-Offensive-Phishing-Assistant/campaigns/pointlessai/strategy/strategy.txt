### Step 7: Post-Phishing Actions
1. **Immediate Notifications**: Immediately inform individuals who clicked on the link that it was a simulated exercise and redirect them to an educational page.
2. **Reporting Mechanism**: Provide details on whom to contact if they realize it was a phishing attempt but failed to report it earlier.

### Step 8: Conduct Training
1. **Feedback Sessions**: Lead sessions to explain the purpose of the exercise, discuss how the phishing email could have been recognized, and how to handle real phishing attempts.
2. **Training Modules**: Provide additional resources such as online courses, tip sheets, and webinars.

### Step 9: Review and Adjust
1. **After-Action Review**: Analyze the campaign data to understand what worked and what didn’t. Adjust the strategy for future campaigns.
2. **Policy Update**: Incorporate learned lessons into company policies and training materials to improve overall security.

### Step 10: Reporting
1. **Document Findings**: Prepare a detailed report summarizing the campaign results, key learnings, and recommendations for improving phishing resilience.
2. **Present to Stakeholders**: Present these findings to upper management and other relevant teams for further action and policy formation.

By following these steps, the red team can ensure that the simulated phishing campaign is as realistic and effective as possible, thereby improving the organization's overall awareness and ability to respond to phishing threats.
