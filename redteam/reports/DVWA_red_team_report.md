# Red Team Security Assessment Report for DVWA

**URL**: [http://127.0.0.1/vulnerabilities/sqli/](http://127.0.0.1/vulnerabilities/sqli/)

---

## 1. Overview of the Application
The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application designed for security enthusiasts to practice common web vulnerabilities under a controlled environment. DVWA intentionally employs outdated coding practices to highlight insecure coding standards for educational purposes.

**Application Version**: v1.10 *Development*

---

## 2. Scope of the Assessment
The Red Team engagement covered:
- Identifying and exploiting potential security flaws.
- Validating the presence of commonly known vulnerabilities.
- Prioritizing identified vulnerabilities based on the risk they pose.
- Providing remediation recommendations.

Assessment specifically targeted known exploit areas, such as:
- SQL injection mechanisms in the search functionality by User ID.

---

## 3. Threat Modeling
**Objective**: Assess the resilience of DVWA against SQL injection attacks.

We analyzed and modeled the application workflow, user inputs, and connections to critical backend services. Reconnaissance identified key areas in the application architecture prone to SQL injection vulnerability:
- User ID input field within the search functionality.

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment
### Vulnerability Identified: SQL Injection in User ID Search

#### Description
SQL Injection enables an attacker to interfere directly with the SQL queries made by the application by exploiting unsanitized user input fields:
1. An attacker provides malicious SQL code via the 'User ID' field.
2. This input is not sanitized or validated, leading to potential query manipulation.

Illustrative HTML code:
```html
<div class="vulnerable_code_area">
    <form action="#" method="GET">
        <p>
            User ID:
            <input type="text" size="15" name="id">
            <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit">
        </p>
    </form>
</div>
```

#### Example Query
Following user input:
```plaintext
1' OR '1' = '1
```
Forming an executed SQL statement:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1' OR '1' = '1';
```

## 5. Attack Simulations
### Steps to Execute SQL Injection
1. **Step 1**: Visit the SQL Injection page at [http://127.0.0.1/vulnerabilities/sqli/](http://127.0.0.1/vulnerabilities/sqli/).
2. **Step 2**: Input payload `1' OR '1' = '1` into the User ID field.
3. **Step 3**: Click the "Submit" button.

### Expected vs. Actual Outputs
- **Expected Result**: Ideally, return records matching `id='User Input'`.
- **Actual Outcome**: All user data returned since the condition `1' = '1` is always true.

---

## 6. Findings and Recommendations
### Findings
- **Type**: SQL Injection.
- **Impacted Areas**: All user data accessible without proper input sanitation.
- **Severity**: High.

### Recommendations
1. **Input Filtering and Sanitation**: Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries to avoid SQL Injection.
2. **Validation**: Strong input validation on the server side to ensure only expected values are processed.
3. **Database Permissions**: Enforce principle of least privilege on database users as a damage control measure.
4. **Security Controls**: Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to identify and block malicious traffic.
5. **Routine Checks**: Conduct frequent security audits and penetration tests to discover potential vulnerabilities before exploitation.

## 7. Conclusion
Although designed for educational purposes, our findings clearly show that without proper security measures, an application like DVWA is critically susceptible to SQL Injection attacks that lead to unauthorized and potentially damaging consequences. Addressing these requires prudent adoption of suggested remediation strategies to safeguard against similar vulnerability occurrences in operational environments.
