"""
Reconnaissance Techniques Using ChatGPT
Custom Tool Development with ChatGPT
This script is for training purposes only

Objectives:
1. Design custom reconnaissance tools by integrating ChatGPT with existing cybersecurity toolkits.
2. Utilize ChatGPT to enhance the capabilities of network scanners with AI-driven analysis and reporting.
3. Develop scripts that employ ChatGPT for real-time data interpretation during active scanning phases.
4. Apply ChatGPT to automate the generation of comprehensive reconnaissance reports.
