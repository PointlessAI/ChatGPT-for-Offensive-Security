"""
Reconnaissance Techniques Using ChatGPT
Automated Vulnerability Identification
This script is for training purposes only

Objectives:
1. Use ChatGPT to process and summarize vulnerability reports relevant to the target's known technologies.
2. Develop a ChatGPT-driven system for tracking and categorizing new vulnerabilities from various security feeds.
3. Apply ChatGPT to correlate discovered vulnerabilities with potential exploitation techniques.
4. Implement ChatGPT to generate initial assessments of the target's security posture based on gathered vulnerability data.
